# hello-world
Just another day...
Hello everyone, I am new to the world of coding but it is one that has already blown my mind and continues to impress and fasinate me everyday.
I am currently studying full course software engineering, I hope to one day work in the games industry as this has always been a passion of mine.
A job in computing would allow me to live out my ideal day everyday.
